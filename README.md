# Roll-a-Ball

This project is practice with the Unity physics engine to create a simple game. 
Roll a ball consists of a player object which must be rolled around the playing field to collect objects.
Once the player collects all objects, the game is complete.

This repository is also practice importing Unity projects into GitHub
